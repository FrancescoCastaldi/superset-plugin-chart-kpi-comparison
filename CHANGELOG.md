# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-29

### Fixed
- **Chart title on a single line**: with `title_in_chart_header` the title, in narrow cards, wrapped onto several lines and covered the value. It now stays on one line and ends with an ellipsis, with the full text in the tooltip on hover. When the card is closed, the style and the tooltip go back to how they were before.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-29

### Added
- **Title in the chart header (`title_in_chart_header`, default off)**: in dashboards, the resolved KPI title, with the dynamic month (for example `Prenotazioni Totali · Settembre 2026`), is written into the chart title in place of the fixed name, and the title inside the card is no longer drawn, so the text does not appear twice and the numeric value gains space. When the card is closed, the original name is restored. Outside the dashboard (Explore) nothing changes. With the option off, the behavior is identical to before.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-10-29

### Added
- **Dynamic previous month with year**: When the comparison label refers to the previous month (default `vs Mese precedente`, variants or with the placeholders `{comp_month}`/`{mese_prec}`), the previous month is injected dynamically with its year (e.g. `vs Mese precedente (Settembre 2026)`). `dynamicCompMonth` is resolved automatically from a column in the query data (`MESE_PRECEDENTE`, `MESE_PENULTIMO`, etc.), with a heuristic fallback computed from the time axis or the current date (`now - 1 month`).
- **Wrap support for the bottom row (`wrap_bottom_content`)**: Added a control in the control panel and the prop `wrapBottomContent` (default: `true`) with `flexWrap: 'wrap'`, `rowGap: '2px'` and `overflow: 'visible'`, so that in narrow dashboard columns (e.g. 3 columns) the comparison text and the badge are not truncated with ellipses (`...`).

## [0.2.6] - 2026-10-26

### Changed
- **Non-Blocking Controls (Zero Required Parameters)**: Removed all `validateNonEmpty` constraints and set `clearable: true` and `validators: []` to guarantee full operational flexibility without blocks in the Superset Explore.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **ESM bundle minified with esbuild**: The new `scripts/build.mjs` (esbuild `^0.25`) generates a single minified `dist/index.esm.js` (targets `es2020`/`chrome110`/`firefox110`/`safari16`, sourcemap linked without `sourcesContent`) with React and `@superset-ui/*` external. `npm run build` now runs `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly` (type `.d.ts` files only) followed by `build:esm`: the `dist/` folder drops from 177.909 B to about 95 KB and the per-module JS files are removed. `main` and `module` both point to `dist/index.esm.js` (before, `main` pointed to `dist/index.js` and `module` to a nonexistent file). The gallery images (~700 KB each) are not inlined: the bundle imports them from `src/images`, already included in the package. Superset keeps compiling the plugin from `src/` via `install.bat`, with no runtime impact.
- **`sideEffects: false`** in `package.json`: the plugin does not import CSS nor run code when modules load, so the host bundler can remove unused exports (tree-shaking).
- **TypeScript strict**: `tsconfig.json` enables `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` and `noImplicitReturns`. Minimal fixes with no behavior change: removed the unused `NumberFormatter` import in `utils/formatters.ts`, the destructured but unused `primaryValue` prop and the constant `isHorizontalCompact` in `KPIComparisonChart.tsx`; in `transformProps.ts` the reference row now explicitly falls back to the first row (guaranteed by `data.length > 0`).
- **React 18 in devDependencies**: `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` move to `^18.2.0`, aligned with the `peerDependencies` (previously `^17`).
### Removed
- **Unused runtime dependencies**: removed `classnames`, `lodash` and `d3-format`, never imported from `src/`. The test mock `supersetCoreMock.js` keeps using the nested `d3-format` v1 copy inside `@superset-ui/core`, so there is no need to move it to devDependencies.

## [0.1.25] - 2026-10-08
### Changed
- **Conservative refactor of `transformProps.ts`**: The pure logic was extracted into dedicated modules without any change to formulas, colors, output props or `controlPanel.tsx`:
  - `utils/trend.ts`: `computeDeltaPercent`, `getTrendDirection` (flat threshold `0.001`), `computeDelta` and `getTrendPolarity` (polarity inversion).
  - `utils/colors.ts`: `getPerceivedBrightness` (W3C brightness formula `(R*299 + G*587 + B*114) / 1000`, previously inline in the percentage badge of the total), `getContrastTextColor` (threshold 125), `toRgbaString`, `getTrendColors` (green/red/neutral badge palette and `subtle` style), `resolveSparklineColor`, `resolveCardBgColor`.
  - `utils/series.ts`: `classifyExtremeTitle` (peak/minimum card), `selectReferenceRow` (reference row for peak/minimum/sparkline) and `extractSparklineData`.
### Added
- **Tests**: Characterization suite for `transformProps` (written and verified green before the refactor) and direct unit tests for each extracted function and for `formatMetricValue`: 165 tests passing (47 pre-existing unchanged + 118 new).
- **`@superset-ui/core` mock**: `test/__mocks__/supersetCoreMock.js` now faithfully replicates `getNumberFormatter` from @superset-ui/core 0.20.4 (registry with `SMART_NUMBER` default, adaptive formatter, d3-format v1 formats with the default locale, handling of invalid formats and of null/NaN/infinite values).

## [0.1.24] - 2026-10-07
### Added
- **Standalone build**: Added the devDependencies `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `@superset-ui/core` and `@superset-ui/chart-controls`, with versions aligned to `superset-frontend` 6.1.0 (React 17, @superset-ui 0.20.x): `npm run build` now exits with 0 even outside the Superset tree, without the TS2307/TS2875 errors. Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps` for zero-friction dependency installation, and `package-lock.json` regenerated with the full tree.
- **Jest unit test suite**: jest + ts-jest setup (same pattern as superset-plugin-chart-hierarchical-table) with `test` and `test:watch` scripts based on the resilient fallback chain. First suite of 47 passing tests covering `utils/formatters.ts` (`formatItalianNumber`, `formatDeltaPercent`, `parseNumericValue`, `getMetricLabel`, `formatMonthYearItalian`) and the branches of `plugin/buildQuery.ts` (dual-metric vs time-shift, suppression of time offsets without a closed range, peak/min metrics, sparkline and row limits).
### Fixed
- **`time_range` typing**: The `time_range` field is now explicitly declared as optional in the `KPIComparisonFormData` interface, resolving the TS2339 error in `buildQuery.ts` without any change to the query logic.

## [0.1.23] - 2026-10-07
### Fixed
- **Rigid idempotence of the registration in `MainPreset.ts`**: The check for an existing configuration in `install-plugin.ps1` now matches the canonical form line by line: `new KPIComparisonChartPlugin().configure({ key: 'kpi_comparison' }),`, with duplicate checks on imports and registrations. Legacy variants with `.register()` and anomalous indentation are normalized to the canonical form instead of being considered already configured.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-10-05
### Added
- **Native visibility controls in Explore**: Added independent checkboxes to show or hide the visual elements of the card with one click, directly from Explore:
  - `show_title` ("Show top title"): turns the title label above the main numeric value on or off.
  - `show_badge` ("Show delta % / percentage badge"): turns the percentage badge in the top right on or off.
  - `show_comparison_label` ("Show comparison text label"): turns the descriptive wording of the comparison on or off (e.g. "vs Mese precedente").
- **Empty space collapse**: Optimized the calculation of dynamic heights in `KPIComparisonChart.tsx` to zero out orphan margins and padding when the top title or the bottom comparison row is deselected.
### Fixed
- **Query leftover suppression**: Guaranteed the complete suppression of time offsets and ghost metrics when the comparison is disabled (`enable_comparison === false`).
### Fixed
- **Install Script Syntax Error**: Fixed a PowerShell syntax error in `install-plugin.ps1` at line 365 (`\[regex\]::Escape` is not valid in PowerShell), replacing it with the native string methods `.Contains()` and `.Replace()` for the Webpack Geostyler patch.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-10-02
### Fixed
- **Time Shift Backend Crash**: Protected backend queries against the An enclosed time range must be specified error when using Time Shift without a time range filter.
- **Time Range Control**: Added 	ime_range picker to the control panel to allow users to set the required bounded range natively on the chart.
- **Time Shift UX**: Added graceful fallback ⚠️ Richiede Filtro Temporale when comparison data is omitted due to missing time range boundaries.


## [0.1.19] - 2026-10-02
### Fixed
- **Sparkline Object Resolution**: Fixed a bug where modern column objects in 	ime_column were incorrectly parsed as strings, causing the sparkline to fail to query multiple rows and render.


## [0.1.18] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- **Fixed CamelCase property mapping bug**: Modern Superset passes `formData` to the frontend as React props formatted in CamelCase, but this plugin's native code looked up properties directly with snake_case notation (e.g. `fd.target_static_value` or `fd.target_metric`). This caused the silent failure of important features such as the **Fixed Target Value**, the **Target Progress Bar**, the dynamic content of the **Percentage Badges** (of the total) and the **Sparkline**, which, although configured, were not rendered on the chart.
- The safe `getProp` function (and `getFd`) was added and applied uniformly across `transformProps.ts` and `buildQuery.ts`; it always evaluates both keys (`camelCase` and `snake_case`) to guarantee correct extraction from `rawFormData` and `formData`.
- **Hidden validators cleanup**: Added `clear_on_hide: true` and removed the mandatory `validators: []` on dropdown fields hidden by the UI, so that the Superset interface does not block the chart's "Run Query" when the mode changes.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- **Option to disable the comparison (`enable_comparison`)**: Introduced a new explicit toggle `Enable comparison / Delta %` in the control panel. When it is off, the card works in pure single-KPI mode, hiding all the controls and labels related to the delta.
- **Direct fixed target support (`static_target`)**: Added the mode `Fixed target value (numeric goal)` among the main calculation choices, allowing the primary metric to be compared directly against a manually entered target value (with the automatic label `vs Obiettivo`).
- **`No Badge` option (`badge_content: 'none'`)**: Added the ability to explicitly disable the top-right badge for a minimal card.

### Changed
- **Dynamic conditional controls**: The secondary controls (`comparison_metric`, `time_compare`, `comparison_label`, `target_metric`, `target_static_value`, `show_progress_bar`, `Delta % & semantic polarity`) now appear only when the comparison is actually enabled (`enable_comparison === true`).
- **Removed mandatory constraint on the comparison metric**: Removed the `validateNonEmpty` validator from `comparison_metric` and enabled `clearable: true`. The red exclamation error mark no longer appears when the second metric is not set.

### Fixed
- **Removed hardcoded SQL fallbacks**: Removed the historical fallbacks `richieste_conf` and `richieste_corr` from `buildQuery.ts`, which caused SQL query errors on datasets lacking those columns when the comparison metric was omitted.
- **Safe comparison resolution**: If `enable_comparison` is false or no comparison metric is configured, `comparisonValue` strictly stays `null` and avoids non-deterministic fallbacks to other numeric columns of the dataset.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- **Global Theme Support**: The plugin now utilizes Superset's global semantic JSON theme tokens (`theme.colors.success`, `theme.colors.error`) instead of hardcoded hex values, ensuring perfect visual sync with custom dashboard themes.
- **Advanced Conditional Formatting**: Added a new configuration `applyTrendColorTo` which allows users to decide if the semantic trend color should be applied exclusively to the Badge, applied to the Main Number text, or painted over the entire Card Background using subtle variants.
- **Interactive Drill-through**: The card can now be turned into a clickable hyperlink. Added a dedicated "Interactivity" tab to configure a URL and a navigation target (`_self` or `_blank`).

## [0.1.15] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- **Percent of Total Badge**: Added the ability to swap the Delta Badge in the top right with a "Percent of Total" badge. Users can now select a `Total Metric` denominator and a custom background color for the badge. When active, it displays the incidence percentage without trend arrows.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- **Target / Goal Tracking Progress Bar**: Added a sleek progress bar at the bottom of the card to track KPI performance against a goal. The target can be defined dynamically via a metric column or as a static absolute number. If the goal is exceeded, the bar fills 100% and changes color to Gold, with text explicitly noting `>100% del Target`.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-10-02

### Changed
- **Data Panel UI Optimization**: Cleaned up the chart configuration panel to reduce cognitive load on initial setup. Renamed the main metric label to `Main metric (required)` and the comparison metric label to `Comparison metric (optional)`.
- **Collapsed Advanced Panels**: The highly detailed configuration panels (`Card appearance & display`, `Card aesthetics`, `Delta % & semantic polarity`) are now collapsed by default (`expanded: false`). This provides a much cleaner, streamlined UI for users configuring the basics, while keeping advanced visual options available on click.

### Fixed
- Fixed TypeScript compile error related to `useId` by replacing it with a generated UUID via `useMemo` for broader React legacy compatibility.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- **Strict column sanitization and fix for the "Missing label (Issue 1011)" error**: Fixed a critical bug where opening in Explore mode or rendering the card triggered the backend exception `ValueError("Missing label")` (`get_column_name` in `superset/utils/core.py`).
- **`time_column` normalization**: Handled the case where `time_column` is saved or passed as an empty array `[]` by the frontend control, preventing a non-string type from being propagated into the `columns` array of the query.
- **`sanitizeColumn` and `sanitizeMetric` filters in `buildQuery.ts`**: Implemented upstream validation and cleanup on both `columns` and `baseQueryObject.columns`, ensuring that only valid string column/metric names or complete ad-hoc objects with `label`/`sqlExpression` are passed.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Dynamic month and year for peak and minimum KPIs**: Introduced the automatic calculation, on multi-row series, of the peak (maximum) and lowest (minimum) value, with automatic detection of the reference month and year (`dynamicMonth`).
- **Conditional rendering of the bottom section**: When a KPI is used in single-metric mode or for peak/minimum without comparison (`hasComparison = false`), the delta badge (`■ --%`) and the `vs Confronto:` label are automatically suppressed, and a clean label with the reference month and year (e.g. "Settembre 2026") is shown below the large number.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Dynamic subtitle and title (data-driven KPI)**: Introduced the new `dynamic_subtitle_column` setting ("Dynamic subtitle column") in the "Card appearance & display" panel. It extracts the actual text or numeric value returned by the SQL query as the filters change and renders it as the subtitle (or inside `kpi_title` and `kpi_subtitle` via the `{dynamic}` placeholder), overcoming the limits of hardcoded descriptions (e.g. "Mese di picco: Settembre 2026").

## [0.1.9] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- **Dual-casing support (`camelCase` & `snake_case`) for controls and form data**: Fixed a critical bug where in Apache Superset 4.x (`ChartRenderer` / `SuperChart`) the card configuration parameters (`suffix_value`, `number_format`, `prefix_value`, `kpi_title`, `card_alignment`, etc.) were converted to camelCase (`suffixValue`, `numberFormat`), resulting in `null`/`undefined` inside `transformProps.ts`. Introduced a transparent `getProp` resolver that inspects both `formData` and `rawFormData` in both naming formats.
- **Display of the percent symbol (`%`) and units**: Restored the correct rendering of `suffixValue` both next to the primary value and in the comparison value row (`vs Confronto: X%`).
- **Precise decimal formatting (`number_format`)**: Restored the application of the configured format string (e.g. `.1f` -> `90,0%`, `99,4%`), preventing the wrong fallback to the integer/float heuristic for unformatted values.
- **Text selection and copy with units**: Removed `userSelect: 'none'` from the prefix and suffix `span` elements, allowing mouse selection and copying of the whole value together with its unit (e.g. `90%`) to the clipboard.

---

## [0.1.8] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed
- **Removed unwanted internal titles ("RICHIESTE_CORR" / "Richieste ecc")**: Removed the automatic fallback that generated internal titles derived from the metric name when `kpi_title` was not set. When no title is specified, the card shows no redundant text inside, leaving full emphasis on the primary number and the delta.
- **Fixed the "Box in a Box" effect**: Set the default `cardBorderRadius` to `square` (0px), `cardBgColor` to `transparent` and `cardBoxShadow` to `none`, for a smooth, native integration inside Superset dashboard containers, without double borders or inner frames.

---

## [0.1.7] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- **Dynamic resolution of month and period in card titles**: Introduced support for dynamic placeholders in the `kpi_title`, `kpi_subtitle` and `comparison_label` fields:
  - `{month}` / `{mese}`: replaced with the actual month of the data (e.g. "Settembre 2026", "Ottobre 2025").
  - `{period}` / `{periodo}`: replaced with the actual time span (e.g. "12 mesi", "6 mesi", "Ottobre 2025 - Settembre 2026").
  - `{comp_month}` / `{mese_prec}`: replaced with the actual comparison month (e.g. "Agosto 2026").
- **Intelligent month auto-discovery**: If the title is configured with standard wording ("Mese di picco", "Mese più basso", "Richieste ultimo mese", "Media mensile"), the plugin automatically extracts the actual month/period from the descriptive metrics of the row (e.g. `mese_picco`, `mese_minimo`, `mese_corrente`, `mese_confronto`, `periodo_mesi`), from multi-row series or from the active time filter, formatting it in Italian with a capitalized initial.

### Changed
- **Preservation of extra metrics and columns in `buildQuery`**: `buildQuery` no longer arbitrarily overwrites the metrics list with only the `[metric, comparison_metric]` pair, allowing descriptive metrics (strings/dates) to be included in the QueryContext without generating duplicate labels.

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- **Installer aligned with the stratum-bar for dependency installation**:
  `npm install` now runs with `--legacy-peer-deps` (the client was failing
  with ERESOLVE on the `@testing-library/dom` peer conflict between
  `@superset-ui/chart-controls` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`). The installation
  starts when `node_modules/typescript/lib/tsc.js` is missing (not only when
  the whole `node_modules` folder is missing), avoiding partial restarts.
- **Local TypeScript pinned to `~5.9.2` in devDependencies**: on the client there is no
  global `tsc`, and the build fallback chain ended with
  MODULE_NOT_FOUND. With a local TypeScript the build uses the 5.9 compiler
  (compatible with the tsconfig, without the TS5107/TS5101 errors of v6).

---

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-21

### Changed
- **`install.bat` aligned with the StratumBar plugin one**: removed the interactive menu
  (options 1-5, GUI, clean reinstall, docker) and replaced with the direct
  runner that executes `install-plugin.ps1` passing any extra arguments
  (`%*`) and waits for Enter. Behavior identical to the `install.bat`
  of stratum-bar, avoiding errors and blocks on the client when running in a
  non-interactive mode.

---

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- **Primary value with sparkline read from the last row**: in
  `dual_metric` mode with an active sparkline, the query is sorted in ascending order
  on the time column (`time_column`) with `row_limit` 50; the
  primary value and the comparison were read from the FIRST row (the most distant period),
  getting the big number and the percentage delta wrong. Now, with sparkline
  active, they are read from the LAST row (the most recent period); without sparkline
  (`row_limit` 1) the behavior stays identical (first row). The
  `time_shift` branch is not touched.
- It serves the KPI "Richieste · mese corrente" (big number = current month, comparison = previous month, sparkline = 12-month series on the lag-1 pair of the view).

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **Fluid dynamic auto-fit and prevention of collapse to 0px**: Fixed a critical overflow bug where, when the height (e.g. the Superset slice title on 2 rows) or the width of the card shrank, the bottom section wrapped onto several lines, took all the vertical space and collapsed the main number container to 0px. Applied `flexShrink: 0`, `minHeight: 0` and `minWidth: 0` so that `text-overflow: ellipsis` really works in the flexbox layout.
- **Continuous dynamic font calculation (clamped [13px, 64px])**: Removed the rigid cap of preset steps (`targetBaseFont`) that locked the font at 18px even with 400px of available width. Introduced a continuous math calculation based on the actual horizontal and vertical footprint, with fluid scaling according to the actual characters.
- **Decoupled size constraints and title handling**: Decoupled the height constraints (`isVerticalCompact`, `isVerticalUltraCompact`) from the width constraints (`isHorizontalCompact`, `isHorizontalUltraCompact`). If the height drops below 90px, the inner title is omitted to give absolute priority to the Main Number and the Delta %, keeping the full title in the native tooltip (`title`). With heights >= 90px and narrow widths (< 180px) the title is scaled to a compact uppercase format with an ellipsis instead of disappearing arbitrarily.
- **Bottom wrapping prevention and smart absolute delta**: The bottom row is permanently locked to a single line (`flexWrap: 'nowrap'`) with `text-overflow: ellipsis` on the secondary comparison metric, to eliminate any risk of vertical layout jumps. The secondary absolute delta indicator `(+123)` is omitted from the badge only when the horizontal width is below 220px (and kept in the badge tooltip), allowing full display in wide cards even when they are short.
- **Sparkline resilience**: The sparkline adapts to heights >= 125px regardless of the card width.

### Added
- **Card aesthetics section**: Added the dedicated section in the Superset Control Panel:
  - `card_bg_color`: Background color customizable via ColorPicker (including transparent support with alpha = 0).
  - `card_border_radius`: Corner radius with options square (0px), soft (8px), rounded (14px) or pill.
  - `card_box_shadow`: Shadow / border with options none, light, pronounced or thin border.

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **Comparison metric extraction from the Superset dataset**: Fixed a critical bug in `transformProps.ts` where `getMetricLabel` extracted only `metric.label` instead of `metric_name` / `verbose_name`. This prevented the benchmark from being extracted (`comparisonMetricKey = ""`), causing the card to fall back to the static `vs Benchmark: —` with delta `—%`.
- **Defensive double fallback for `comparisonValue`**: Added heuristic keyword search (`conf`, `prev`, `comp`, `prec`, `bench`) and automatic fallback to any secondary numeric column present in the row, guaranteeing 100% extraction of the comparison value in `dual_metric` mode.
- **Control visibility in Explore**: Fixed a bug in `controlPanel.tsx` where `comparison_metric` was hidden by default when opening Explore, before `calculation_mode` was explicitly selected.
- **Query Builder robustness**: In `buildQuery.ts`, ensured the correct inclusion of both metrics in the query, both from `metric`/`comparison_metric` and from the `metrics` array.
- **Smart dynamic label**: Replaced the default fallback `'vs Benchmark'` with `'vs Confronto'` and set the default title to `'Richieste in attesa'` in place of the raw string `richieste_corr`.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- **GUI layout bug fix**: Corrected the WinForms docking order (`headerPanel.SendToBack()`) in `KPIComparisonInstallerGUI.cs`, which caused the header to overlap and section 1 (Superset path) to be cut off.
- **Alignment and margins**: Applied consistent horizontal padding (`padX = 24`) to all controls, labels and log boxes.
- **Native non-dev Docker support**: Added the dedicated option for `docker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up -d --build superset` both in the GUI executable and in `install.bat`.
- **Repository visibility**: GitHub repository set to **Public**: `https://github.com/FrancescoCastaldi/superset-plugin-chart-kpi-comparison`.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Official plugin architecture**: Initialization of the `superset-plugin-chart-kpi-comparison` plugin for Apache Superset, compliant with the `@superset-ui/core` standard.
- **All-in-one KPI card**: Compact view with the primary metric highlighted, comparison value, absolute delta and integrated percentage delta ($\Delta\%$).
- **Hybrid calculation modes**:
  - `Explicit dual metric`: direct calculation $\Delta\% = \frac{\text{Rif} - \text{Conf}}{\text{Conf}} \times 100$ for already aggregated datasets (e.g. two metrics in the same row).
  - `Time Shift`: support for native Superset time offsets (`1 year ago`, `1 month ago`, `1 week ago`, etc.).
- **Color semantics and inverted polarity**:
  - Standard polarity: increase in green (`#10b981`), decrease in red (`#ef4444`).
  - Inverted polarity (`invert_polarity`): decrease in green and increase in red (essential in healthcare for waiting times, cancellation rate, no-shows and costs).
- **Delta badge styles**: Choice between rounded pill badge (`pill`), compact box (`full`) or minimal understated text (`subtle`).
- **Italian number formatting**: Dedicated utility for thousands separator (dot) and decimals (comma), with support for prefixes (e.g. `€`) and suffixes (e.g. `%`, `pz`).
- **Built-in time sparkline**: High-efficiency pure-SVG component to trace the trend line, with an optional gradient fill at the base of the card.
- **Superset Control Panel**: Explore sections for query configuration, typography, alignment (left, center, right), polarity and graphic options.
- **Automation and deploy**:
  - PowerShell script `install-plugin.ps1` with automatic detection of the Superset directory, synchronized copy, safety backup and idempotent update of `MainPreset.ts`.
  - Interactive Windows launcher with double-click `install.bat`.
  - `README.md` documentation and directive tracking in `AGENTS.md`.
